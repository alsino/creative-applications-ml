# Creative Applications of Machine Learning â€“  <br/> A Hands-On Workshop for (Absolute) Beginners

This is a repository with all the code and materials for the DAAD Alumni-Workshop at daadgalerie_studio, 21 October 2019, 10am - 4pm. 

This workshops draws heavily on the friendly open source projects [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which you should check out. 

A special and big shoutout to [Yining Shi](https://github.com/yining1023) who developed many of the materials provided here. The curriculum of this workshop was heavily inspired by Yining's introductiory course on [Bots and Machine Learning](https://schoolofma.org/bots) at the School of Machines in the summer of 2019 and her [Machine Learning for the Web's](https://github.com/yining1023/machine-learning-for-the-web) class at ITP in New York.

## Housekeping

We are collecting all links and non-code materials on our [EtherPad](https://etherpad.net/p/creative-applications-ml). This way we can exchange materials and links on the fly with everybody without having to set up a chat group or slack.  


## Agenda

**10am - 12pm: Introduction to Machine Learning**
- A Quick Introduction to Machine Learning ([Presentation](https://github.com/alsino/creative-applications-ml/blob/master/presentation/daad-ml-intro_compressed.pdf))
- Hands-on 1: A very basic introduction to JavaScript and p5.js

**12pm - 1pm: Lunch Break**

**1pm - 4pm: Machine Learning with ml5.js and Runway**
- Hands-on 2: Image classification with MobileNet
- Hands-on 3: Pose estimation (PoseNet) with ml5.js
- Hands-on 4: Generate images from text (AttnGan-Runway)
- Next steps: Where to go from here? (Resources)
- Feedback

## Topics
- What is Machine Learning (ML)? 
- What are some of the most important concepts in ML?
- What are common applications of machine learning?
- Why should we engage with creative applications of ML?
- What are tools we can use in creative ML applications?


## Get started
To run each code example, open your terminal (HowTo: [Mac](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/) or [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/#targetText=Open%20Command%20Prompt%20from%20the,open%20an%20administrator%20Command%20Prompt.)) and type in the following commands:
```
Clone this repository (folder)
$ git clone https://github.com/alsino/creative-applications-ml.git

Go to the folder you have just downloaded
$ cd creative-applications-ml

Go to the specific example folder we are working in, i.e. for the first imageClassification example:
$ cd 1-imageClassification

Start up a simple web server in the current directory (note: you will need to have python installed on your machine)
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer     # $ python3 -m http.server (if you are using python 3)



```
