# Creative Applications of Machine Learning â€“  <br/> A Hands-On Workshop for (Absolute) Beginners

This is a repository with all the code and materials for the DAAD Alumni-Workshop at daadgalerie_studio, 21 October 2019, 10am - 4pm. 

This workshops draws heavily on the friendly open source projects [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which you should check out. 

A special and big shoutout to [Yining Shi](https://github.com/yining1023) who developed many of the materials provided here. The curriculum of this workshop was heavily inspired by Yining's introductiory course on [Bots and Machine Learning](https://schoolofma.org/bots) at the School of Machines in the summer of 2019 and her [Machine Learning for the Web's](https://github.com/yining1023/machine-learning-for-the-web) class at ITP in New York.
